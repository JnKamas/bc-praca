## Description
This repository contains the code for my bachelor's thesis in Data Science. The `apportionment.py` file contains backend code that encapsulates all necessary methods and classes for apportionment methods, data generating algorithms with bootstrap, and methods that help transform data into visualizable content. This structure is designed to keep Jupyter notebooks concise and focused.

Raw generated won't be available on GitHub due to its size, which amounts to tens of gigabytes. Nevertheless, you can generate it using my code, though the expected computation time spans over a few days. Trasformed data are available inside `vis_data` folder.

Note that the data were generated randomly in 500 iterations and averaged using bootstrap method. Your generated data might be a little different. 



## Installation and Dependencies
This project requires Python 3.8 or newer installed.
You can install the required libraries using the following commands:
 `pip install [name_of_library]` or `conda install [name_of_library]` depending on your Python distribution.

## Documentation
While there is a reasonable amount of commentary inside my code, you can find more detailed explanations in my bachelor thesis, which will be available upon completion.
